				<h3 class="text-center">Automated Public Distribution Shop (APDS)</h3>
				<p style="text-align:justify">The main objective of project was to create a web application which can be used by the public distribution shops across India. 
					The application developed can determine the authentic user and we also implemented bar code reader in order to read the cards to populate essential information to verify the consumer. 
					The application also creates reports on weekly, monthly and yearly basis. 
					It can also be controlled by 3 sets of users, each user has different roles and privileges assigned. 
					My role in the project was to design front end web pages. 
					Primary focus was on ease of use. 
					Since the end user of such application were probably are the people with less knowledge over computers so we needed to give them more ease of use by automating some the primary tasks. For instance, populating the data of user, populating the card details to the new report and creating an audit report.

				<h3 class="text-center">Genetic Algorithm implementation</h3>
				<p style="text-align:justify">A genetic algorithm is method of solving optimization problems, 
				which rely upon natural selection process that imitate biological evolution.In this project 
				I used JAVA to create a GUI based protein structure simulator, 
				which uses genetic algorithm in order to find the best solution.</p>
				
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-3">
				<h3 class="text-center">Virtual Classroom Implementation using java</h3>
				<p style="text-align:justify">Implemented an API package port_channel in Java. This customized API package implement two solutions, Java socket and Java NIO.
				Then, illustrated the capabilities of this API package by using it in a virtual classroom.
				In a virtual classroom, a teacher has to listen to every student’s message while he/she is lecturing (broadcasting messages to every student).
				The project was mainly focused to demonstrate the usage of JAVA NIO. 
				Utilize channels to create communication between students and teachers in a virtual class environment where students can raise the doubts, chat within the class and as well as attendance facility.
				Extensively used threads concept to implement individual channels among clients.</p>
